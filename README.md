# Leitner-Box
#### Leitner Box is a memorization using a box with five cells. Cards with question and answer will be put in the first cell, then move to the next cell when we got it correct. Otherwise, it will move back to the first cell regardless it is now placed. If a card reaches the fifth cell and we got it correct, which means we perfectly memorized it, it will be emitted from the box.

### This program is based on Nodejs, html and ejs.

#### Initial Screen consists of six buttons. Top 3 buttons are related to word learning. Each are connected to 'learning', 'card adding', 'view all cards' menu. Bottom 3 buttons are related to image card learning and orders are same as those of word learning.
